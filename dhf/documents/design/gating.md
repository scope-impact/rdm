# Gating — Software Design

## Design Inputs

This context owns:

- **DI-2 (design gate)** — block the transition into implementation until the
  per-context design documents and the design review are present, complete, and
  approved (committed) in git; a later edit re-opens the gate. Refines UN-002.
- **DI-3 (release gate)** — block release unless every declared design input is
  verified by a passing test. Refines UN-003.
- **DI-26 (design-gate-only hooks default)** — `rdm hooks` installs only the
  design-gate pre-commit hook by default; the legacy issue-reference hooks
  (commit-msg / prepare-commit-msg) are installed only with
  `--with-issue-hooks`. RDM's own repo deleted them; downstream defaults
  should match. Refines UN-002.

Retired (Design Review 4): DI-19, DI-20, DI-21, DI-27 and DI-28 — the
faithfulness gate, verdict recorder, mutation probe, replayable probes and
verdict hash scope. Independent confirmation that a test means something is
the human-reviewed pull request, not a per-input verdict. These ids are not
reused.

## Design Outputs

Enforces design controls and verified coverage.

- **Design gate** (`rdm/story_audit/design_gate.py`) — the per-context design
  documents and the review must be present, free of placeholders, and approved
  (committed clean) in git; an edit to an approved document re-opens the gate.
- **Pre-commit hook** (`rdm/hook_files/pre-commit`) — blocks committing
  implementation work until the design gate passes; commits of the design docs
  themselves are allowed (that commit is the approval).
- **Release gate** (`run_release_gate`) — blocks release unless every design
  input is verified by a passing test and every user need is addressed.

Acceptance criteria are verified by `@allure.story("DI-2" / "DI-3" / "DI-26")`
tests.
